While the site covers a total area of 0.41 acres (0.17 hectares), with Radlett Place on one side, it is therefore a substantial distance from its neighbours.\nACCOMMODATION\n•Master Bedroom Suite (with large Dressing Room and Bathroom)\n•6/7 further Bedrooms with 2 Bathrooms\n•Drawing Room\n•Study\n•Dining Room\n•Kitchen/Breakfast Room\n•Morning room\n•Utility Room\n•Cloakroom\n•Double Garage\nThe property occupies a superlative position in St John’s Wood. As one of the first leafy villages you encounter north west of Mayfair (only 10mins drive away).\nThe property is rich with refurbishment/redevelopment potential. Extensive research has been undertaken, details of which can be provided upon request.\nBrochures\n364002 Avenue Road WEB VERSION.pdf\nBrochure",

    "description": "Situated on a large corner plot, this property of ambassadorial proportions offers a rare opportunity to own a complete, stuccoed villa in need of renovation. Spanning 10,290 sq ft, the property comes with planning permission for substantial internal alterations, which would take the total internal area to around 15,000 sq ft.\nThis property is one of the 88 Italianate villas built from 1860 by renowned brothers William and Francis Radford. The project, approved by Lord Holland, was executed to deliver “good, proper and substantial” residences.\nLofty proportions, striking architectural features, and ample open spaces – all crowned by a rich provenance – offer an exceptional foundation for a restoration project.\nThe ground floor has a high-ceilinged drawing room along with a formal dining room flooded with natural light thanks to its imposing, triple-aspect bay windows. The first floor is dedicated to the principal suite, while the remaining eight rooms and three bathrooms are arranged across the second and third floors. The lower ground floor offers further reception rooms which can be transformed to suit individual needs. There’s also provision for a 33-foot swimming pool.\nThe large garden provides off-street parking for at least four cars, with the planning permission in place for two additional storeys to be built beneath the plot. Additional open spaces include the principal suite’s private balcony and two patios on the lower ground floor.\nThe existing passenger lift is a notable highlight, as the planning permission does not allow for such an addition.\nThis property has a prime position in the heart of Holland Park, moments away from the neighbourhood’s eponymous park and the cherished Kyoto Garden. Holland Park and Notting Hill Gate underground stations are located within walking distance.",

    "description": "A masterpiece of mansion apartment living, Knightsbridge Gate is a Grade II listed building with a retained, Edwardian façade, comprising 15 meticulously designed residences.\nDescription\nBuilt in 1902, Knightsbridge Gate is a Grade II listed building originally designed by architect W.D. Caröe for the Church Commissioners. The building retains the original façade in the Edwardian style, which has been painstakingly restored to preserve the heritage and glamour associated with Knightsbridge.\nWhere the North elevation has been restored, the South façade is entirely new, featuring stepped pergolas and terraces. The development has been designed so that the apartment’s principle rooms overlook the remarkable landscape of Belgravia. The quality of finish and attention to detail enhances the scale and grandeur of the building. MSMR architects have been responsible for transforming the internal spaces, drawing on the Edwardian heritage of the building with contemporary elements. A rich palette of materials, colours and texture, combined with intricate detailing and bespoke joinery, have created elegant interiors of the highest calibre.\nThe building is located at the gateway to Knightsbridge, moments from Hyde Park’s Southern border, Harrods and Harvey Nichols. Many of the apartments benefit from South-facing aspects towards Belgravia and the corner homes have views into Hyde Park.\nLight and bright, the living spaces are inspired by the building’s historical beauty, the rich environs of Knightsbridge and contemporary fashion, with meticulous modern detailing and an exemplary choice of materials throughout.\nLocation\nOne of the world’s most prestigious residential addresses, Knightsbridge offers the best of everything. A magnificent 350 acres of green space at Hyde Park. Internationally renowned retail and restaurants. Charming cobbled streets, artisan shops, five-star hotels and exceptional connections.\nThe evolution of Knightsbridge’s latest destinations is attracting some of the best retailers in London and a carefully curated selection of shops and bars. Cobbled Motcomb Street is lined with independent boutiques, and Pavillion Road is the ideal place for artisan brands and high-end eateries.\nSquare Footage: 6,214 sq ft\nLeasehold with approximately 996 years remaining.\nAdditional Info\nService Charge: £15/sqft - excludes building insurance\nBrochures\nWeb Details",

    "description": "This stuccoed villa features stunning Roman arches, portals, and balustrades, with a tall tower positioned to the left of the façade.\nOriginally built in 1840 by Matthew Wyatt under John Nash’s master plan for the Regent’s Canal, which created Little Venice, the property sits in a picturesque neighborhood of Regent’s Park-style villas bordering the canal.\nFormerly the home of Royal Mistress Lillie Langtry, where she entertained Bertie, the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII), and more recently Irish-American dancer Michael Flatley, this residence is offered for sale for the first time in 20 years, presenting a rare opportunity to own one of central London’s finest homes.\nIn excellent condition, the home is designed in a restrained yet expansive Classical style, featuring magnificent formal entertaining rooms, a principal bedroom suite overlooking the canal, and a lower ground floor swimming pool complex inspired by classical Rome and the English country house.\nThe villa sits on a 0.255-acre corner plot, set back from the road and approached through twin gates, with a pedestrian entrance. The property overlooks Regent’s Canal and includes a secluded wraparound garden, a large carriage drive, additional secure off-street parking, and an integral double garage.\nThe property also boasts a mature wraparound garden with two separate areas, one featuring Lillie Langtry’s famous love-seat and the other a rear terrace leading to the principal lawned garden. Additional highlights include a carriage drive, secure off-street parking for multiple vehicles, a double-width integral garage, a swimming pool complex with an adjoining gym, sauna, shower room, and WC, three terraces, a balcony, a wine cellar, a utility/vault, and a plant room.\nPlease use the reference 518473 when contacting us.",
